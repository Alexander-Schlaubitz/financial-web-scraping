# financial-web-scraping
This repository contains all necessary files and codes to scrape financial information from Yahoo Finance and Investing.com and other websites to conduct stock evaluation based on fundamental and alternative data.

Necessary Python libraries are all stated in the jupyter notebook. The files dcf.PNG, ddm.PNG, ko_sentiment.xlsx and word_list.csv must be in the same folder as the jupyter notebook to ensure full functionality. The other five .xlsx files (gild, ibm, intc, jnj and ko) are not required for the code to work. Given that Yahoo Finance will update their financial statements at a given point, the five files represent historical data as created in December 2020. The jupyter notebook contains code that can be used to import these files and thus recreate a working file, even when it is not adapted to current Yahoo Finance changes.
