    "# Research Paper: Web Scraping and Fundamental Analysis\n",
    "by Alexander Schlaubitz and Gaudenz Dual  \n",
    "January 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook shows how the user can scrape financial data from an American stock by simply entering its ticker in lowercase, e.g. for Coca Cola enter 'ko'. The notebook is split into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 1\n",
    "In the first part, financial statements and other figures of a company are scraped from the web. These included income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, valuations measures, such as PE ratios and a historical dividend overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2\n",
    "In the second part, the scraped data is used to calculate the intrinsic stock value of the company, based on a dividend discount model, a discounted cash flow model, a multiples evaluation and an aggregation of other financial analyst's price targets. The different models are combined to create a graphical output that can be used to create buy, hold or sell recommendation for the company. This part represents the fundamental analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3\n",
    "In a third step, natural language processing is applied to scraped news articles from Reuters.com. The news articles are analyzed based on sentiment (positive / negative) and that information is taken as a trend indication for the sentiment of the stock. \n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical background to the different applications and models can be found in the written paper for this project. The code is further explained with comments and can be used as a reference when reading the paper. Running this notebook requires the user to have access to the following Python libraries:\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "- openpyxl\n",
    "- BeautifulSoup\n",
    "- Selenium - Detailed information on how to install the executable path for the Chrome browser can be found here: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html\n",
    "- yfinance\n",
    "- nltk\n",
    "\n",
    "For easier display of code functionality, a screencaptured video of the working code is handed in together with the paper and this code. Additionally, given that Yahoo Finance and Investing.com, the two main references in the scraping process may spontaneously change their layouts or scraping policies, the scraped data for five sample companies, namely Coca Cola, Johnson& Johnson, Gilead Sciences, Intel and IBM, has been downloaded and stored in excel format, which can be imported in the code to show its functionality in retrospect."

However, in case of an error, we recommend to run the respective part couple more times to be sure that there was not an error with the internet connection. Also we recommend not to interfere with inputs from the mouse or keyboard while the code is running."

Income statements on Yahoo Finance usually have data from 31.12.2016 to 31.12.2019, including a TTM overview. However, not all stocks have this income statement layout, for example Apple with ticker 'AAPL' does not have any data for 2016 on Yahoo Finance. Hence, the code was programmed in a flexible way to account for these inconsistencies."

Numpy cannot calculate with strings and therefore B and T were turned into the correct amount of zeros and attached to the number. The same applies for numbers such as '122.08', these are all stored as strings and not as numbers thus calculating 122.08 + 122.08 would give us 122.08122.08 instead of 244.16. The same applies to the data stored in balance_sheet, cash_flow and income_statement. As this is applied to all three we define the process ofchanging strings to integers in a function."

    "When using investing.com, the first thing we notice is that its URL search is not as intuitive as with Yahoo Finance, where we can directly access a stocks website using its ticker in the url. Investing.com is using the complete name of a company in the URL, for example Bank of America with the ticker BA has the following URL: https://www.investing.com/equities/bank-of-america-dividends\n",
    "\n",
    "We could now either create a dict where we assign each ticker its real name (for example {'BAC' : 'bank-of-america'} and then directly scrape the data from the website using Beautifulsoup as we did for the income statement. However, by creating a dict we would have to limit ourselves to a certain amount of stocks, as we have to create the dict by hand and thus indicate which stocks can be reviewed and which not. We prefer to have a little more flexibility work our way around this by using Selenium to guide ourselves automatically through the website."

The model uses Vader, a lexicon based sentiment tool to compute a news article sentiment score. Since Vader is not constructed based on finance news, we update the Vader lexicon with further words from Loughran McDonald. Finally, the model shows the most extreme news articles and the overal sentiment score, which ranges from -1 (really negative) to 1 (really positive)."

Since Vader was created for social media related text, we adapted the model with additional features. This part will analyse the results for both, the original and adapted model. In order to do so we use pre scraped and pre classified news articles for Coca Cola. The interpreted results and further recommendations for improvements are presented in the research paper. As the testing of model accuracy requires human input, it cannot be done for every single company. Therefore this was created as a one time test with Coca Cola."
